[crc string x 32 bits]
[name len uint8][name string]
[type bytes x column count][null type byte]

indices:
    handled as b-trees
    i.e. for phrase: root has X branches where X is the number of first characters
    then each of those has Y branches where Y is the number of second characters after that first character

pages:
    contain data. thats it
    types of page:
        index (contains a b-tree)
